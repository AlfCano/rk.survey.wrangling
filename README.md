# rk.survey.wrangling
Extends RKWard’s capabilities to handle complex survey designs (svydesign objects). It leverages the {srvyr} package to apply modern, “tidy” manipulation verbs (like mutate, group_by, and across) to survey data while automatically preserving sampling weights, stratification, and variance estimation parameters.
